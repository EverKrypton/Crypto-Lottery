# Crypto-Lottery Web App:
A Next.Js Web app for crypto-lottery, where users can buy tickets using MATIC cryptocurrency for the lottery, and an admin draws the winner using Solidity Smart contract backend, and thirdweb servers for connecting functionality.
All of the WEB3 transactions are currently registred on MATIC Mumbai (a test-net for the MATIC cryptocurrency) to prevent real currency transactions, other than that transaction real and appear between wallets.

## Project Technological Stack:
* NextJS & Vercel for quick start and deployment.
* ReactJS for the UI.
* Typescript & Javascript for typing.
* TailwindCSS for styling.
* Solidity for smart contracts.
* Thirdweb for deploying the smart contract.
